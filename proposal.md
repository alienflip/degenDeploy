# degenDeploy

In this project, we fork [webb-tools implimentation of tornado-core](https://github.com/webb-tools/tornado-core), deploy the tornado core contract to harmony test-net using a 'public' (traceable) account, and then extend the tools provided to demonstrate how to deploy another a contract as an anonymous user, using a dummy account!

# Application Type

> zkApp

# Proposal Overview

> Within the scope of this proposal, the MVP is to implement a workflow which (0) enables the user to deploy a mixer using their testnet account, (1) test the mixer by inserting transactions into it, (2) recieving secret notes from said transactions, (3) extracting funds, and deploying new contract.

## Use Cases

1. For any actor who wishes to provide a service with anonymity
2. For any actor who wishes to interact with another service with anonymity

# Proposal Ask

In order to get this up and running, we request $15k/year stable basic income to take care of welfare and development costs. $3k per milestone.

This ask will be in line with the laid down milestones as detailed below

1. launching a feature-complete product on testnet 
2. forming a DAO with 5-out-of-9 multisig with our DAOs 
3. launching on ONE mainnet
4. attracting 1k daily active users (with launch video, PR promotion) 
5. attracting 10k daily active users (with a detailed roadmap, governance process)
