# Application Type

> zkApp

# Proposal Overview

> In this app, make a walkthrough which culminates in deploying a contract as an anon to the harmony testnet, using zero knowledge proofs, through the use of a mixer. This tool will do it all for you, except the physical IP handling.

## Use Cases

1. For any actor who wishes to provide a service with anonymity
2. For any actor who wishes to interact with another service with anonymity

# Proposal Ask

In order to get this up and running, we request $15k/year stable basic income to take care of welfare and development costs. $3k per milestone.

This ask will be in line with the laid down milestones as detailed below

1. launching a feature-complete product on testnet 
2. forming a DAO with 5-out-of-9 multisig with our DAOs 
3. launching on ONE mainnet ( initial version already available on ONE mainnet) 
4. attracting 1k daily active users (with launch video, PR promotion) 
5. attracting 10k daily active users (with a detailed roadmap, governance process)
