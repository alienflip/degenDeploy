# degenDeploy

In this project, we fork [webb-tools implimentation of tornado-core](https://github.com/webb-tools/tornado-core), and extend the tools provided to demonstrate how to deploy a contract as an anonymous user, using a dummy account!

# Application Type

> zkApp

# Proposal Overview

> Within the scope of this proposal, the MVP is to implement a workflow which enables the user to interact with the deployed a mixer using their mainnet account, commit transactions into it, and recieving secret notes from said transactions, then extract funds to a burner and deploy new contract from the burner.

## Use Cases

1. For any actor who wishes to provide a service with anonymity
2. For any actor who wishes to interact with another service with anonymity

# Proposal Ask

In order to get this up and running, we request $15k/year stable basic income to take care of welfare and development costs.

This ask will be in line with the laid down milestones as detailed below

1. launching a feature-complete product on our testnet
2. forming a DAO with 5-out-of-9 multisig with our DAOs
3. launching on our mainnet with audit
4. attracting 1k daily active users (with launch video, full PR promotion)
5. attracting 10k daily active users (with a detailed roadmap, governance process)
